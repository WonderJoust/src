What is Tanglewood Forest?
--------------------------
[Tanglewood Forest (TWF)] [1] is a popular, classic [Multi-User Domain (MUD)] [2], which means it's a text-based adventure game on the internet. It was developed by Alan Button, a.k.a. Greyclaw, by extending the [ROM codebase] [3] with a general-purpose "softcode" parser for building complex situations for players. The game attracted a large base of addicted players and a corps of talented builders. Greyclaw himself abandoned the game several years ago. The current implementation started with Greyclaw's final codebase and world database distribution, and has many added capabilities and features, bug fixes, and new areas for players to explore.

Invitation to Adventure!
------------------------
Are you ~~dumb~~ambitious enough to want to administer your own MUD? This is the codebase for you! Not only was the original MUD considered *very* difficult as a player, managing the codebase, instance files, tables, and softcode are a ~~nightmare~~joy!

This code is part of the [MUD] [1]->[AberMUD] [2]->[DikuMUD] [3]->[Copper] [4]->[MERC] [5]->[ROM] [6]->[The Forest's Edge] [7] family of MUDs. If you would like more information on the TFE family tree, I have also been trying to collect all of our variations over the years at [http://tfe.thefightingferret.com/] [8]. If you do end up running away with the code to build your greatest text-based fantasy, just remember it comes with all inherited rights and permissions as any of the previous iterations.

Typical Disclaimer
------------------
Insert typical disclaimer of no help, no warrenties, no etcs.

No Areas, Objects, Mobs, or Tables?
-----------------------------------
Correct. As these are the files or authorship in the MUD itself, these are not necessarily open for distribution. I want those building in my server to retain some sort of exclusivity to their asset files. Naturally, that doesn't stop someone from jumping on the free-to-play server and copying everything down by hand, but hey, if you want it that bad, who's going to stop you, eh?

All hardcoded people, places, or things should be relatively obvious in the code itself, and if not, the MUD will and not boot properly and complain as to what it wants. File formats are similar to that which was instilled by Severus in his earlier version of TFE Classic.

### Thank you and have fun! ###
